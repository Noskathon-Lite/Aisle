This project optimizes the shortest route between two cities in the Kathmandu Valley using real-world road network data. The code takes a CSV dataset containing city locations (latitude and longitude), builds a road network graph using OSM data with `osmnx`, and computes the shortest path between a user-defined starting and destination city using Dijkstraâ€™s algorithm. The cities are visualized on a map, with the starting city marked in red and the destination city in blue. Once the optimal route is calculated, it is visualized on an interactive map with the route marked, and saved as an HTML file for further reference.

To use the project, simply load the dataset, input the desired cities, and the script will calculate and visualize the most efficient route. The results include an initial map showing all cities and a route map showing the optimized path, both saved as HTML files.
